Here's how the loan process works: When someone needs money, they apply for a loan from a bank, corporation, government, or other entity. The borrower may be required to provide specific details such as the reason for the loan, their financial history, Social Security number (freedom cash lenders), and other information. The lender reviews this information as well as a person's debt-to-income (freedom cash lenders) ratio, to determine if the loan can be paid back.1

Based on the applicant's creditworthiness, the lender either denies or approves the application. The lender must provide a reason should the loan application be denied. If the application is approved, both parties sign a contract that outlines the details of the agreement. The lender advances the proceeds of the loan, after which the borrower must repay the amount, including any additional charges, such as interest.
