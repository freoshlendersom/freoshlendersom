A loan is a form of credit where a specific amount of money is given to someone with the agreement that it will be paid back later. In many cases, the lender also adds interest or finance charges to the principal value, which the borrower must repay in addition to the principal balance.

Loans may be for a specific, one-time amount, or they may be available as an open-ended line of credit up to a specified limit. Loans come in many different forms, including secured, unsecured, commercial, and personal loans.
